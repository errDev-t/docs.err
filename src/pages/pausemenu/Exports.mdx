# Exports

Nil's Pausemenu provides several exports that allow other resources to interact with the pause menu functionality.

## Available Exports

### getPauseMenuState

This export allows you to check if the pause menu is currently active or not.

```lua
-- Returns: boolean (true if pause menu is open, false if closed)
local isPauseMenuOpen = exports['nil-pausemenu']:getPauseMenuState()
```

## Implementation Example

Here's how you can use the `getPauseMenuState` export in your own resource:

```lua
-- client.lua

-- Check if pause menu is open before performing an action
RegisterCommand('my_command', function()
    local isPauseMenuOpen = exports['nil-pausemenu']:getPauseMenuState()
    
    if isPauseMenuOpen then
        -- Pause menu is open, handle accordingly
        print('Cannot execute command while pause menu is open')
        return
    end
    
    -- Continue with command execution
    print('Command executed successfully')
    -- Your command logic here...
end, false)
```
